> Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.

Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code?

This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. [Try it using our editor][live-editor].

# Online live editor

An editor is available for creating diagrams. With it you can quickly start writing mermaid diagrams. It is possible to:

* save the result as a svg
* get a link to a viewer of the diagram
* get a link to edit of the diagram to share a diagram so that someone else can tweak it and send a new link back

* [Editor][live-editor]
