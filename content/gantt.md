# Gantt diagrams

> A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, first developed by Karol Adamiecki in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.

Mermaid can render Gantt diagrams.
 ```mermaid

## Syntax

A task is defined by an ID, a start date, and either an end date or duration.
If a task depends on an other task, a begin date is not required.

By default, a task is added just after the previous task, see Task 2 below. In this way, Task 2 becomes a dependency of Task 1. You can also explicitly give a dependency using the id of the prerequisite, see Task 3.

```mermaid
gantt

    Task 1           :a1, 2014-01-01, 2014-01-30
    Task 2           :15d
    Task 3           :after a1, 15d
```

### Title

Add a title above the diagram.

```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram

    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d


```


## Sections statements

You can divide the gantt diagram into sections.

```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram

    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d

    section Another Section
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d
```

## Styling

Styling of the a gantt diagram is done by defining a number of css classes.  During rendering these classes are extracted from the

### Classes used

Class | Description
---          | ---
actor        | Style for the actor box at the top of the diagram.
text.actor   | Styles for text in the actor box at the top of the diagram.
actor-line   | The vertical line for an actor.
messageLine0 | Styles for the solid message line.
messageLine1 | Styles for the dotted message line.
messageText  | Defines styles for the text on the message arrows.
labelBox     | Defines styles label to left in a loop.
labelText    | Styles for the text in label for loops.
loopText     | Styles for the text in the loop box.
loopLine     | Defines styles for the lines in the loop box.
note         | Styles for the note box.
noteText     | Styles for the text on in the note boxes.

### Sample stylesheet


```css
.grid .tick {
    stroke: lightgrey;
    opacity: 0.3;
    shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}
.grid path {
    stroke-width: 0;
}

#tag {
    color: white;
    background: #FA283D;
    width: 150px;
    position: absolute;
    display: none;
    padding:3px 6px;
    margin-left: -80px;
    font-size: 11px;
}

#tag:before {
    border: solid transparent;
    content: ' ';
    height: 0;
    left: 50%;
    margin-left: -5px;
    position: absolute;
    width: 0;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-bottom-color: #FA283D;
    top: -20px;
}
.taskText {
    fill:white;
    text-anchor:middle;
}
.taskTextOutsideRight {
    fill:black;
    text-anchor:start;
}
.taskTextOutsideLeft {
    fill:black;
    text-anchor:end;
}
```


## Configuration

Is it possible to adjust the margins for rendering the gantt diagram.

This is done by defining the `ganttConfig` part of the configuration object.
How to use the CLI is described in the [mermaidCLI](mermaidCLI.html) page.

mermaid.ganttConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.

```javascript
mermaid.ganttConfig = {
    titleTopMargin:25,
    barHeight:20,
    barGap:4,
    topPadding:75,
    sidePadding:75
}
```

### Possible configration params:

Param | Descriotion | Default value
--- | --- | ---
mirrorActor|Turns on/off the rendering of actors below the diagram as well as above it|false
bottomMarginAdj|Adjusts how far down the graph ended. Wide borders styles with css could generate unwantewd clipping which is why this config param exists.|1
